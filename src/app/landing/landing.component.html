    <h1>Easy to understand Advanced Stats</h1>
    <p>Determing whether a player is playing well goes much deeper than just the basic box score. Stats like points, rebounds, and assists sometimes fail to tell the entire story. Teams have been using different metrics to quantify a player's performance
        for years, but these advanced stats are more difficult to understand. This website will walk you through different ways to determine a player's efficiency, and show how players and teams stack against each other.
